Given the image with its description as "!<INPUT 2>!", and a target question "!<INPUT 1>!", please generate at most three sub-questions that can solve the target question step by step.
So that answering these sub-questions can approach to the final answer with the shortest logical path.

Output these sub-questions with the format as follows, and separate the sub-question by comma:
Sub-questions: sub-question 1, sub-question 2, ...

Don't generate questions that are irreverent to the target question, or make the question more complex to answer.
If the target question is already obvious to solve according to the given information, output the target question directly as
Sub-questions: target question
