!<INPUT 1>! -- target object
!<INPUT 2>! -- main question
!<INPUT 3>! -- caption

Given the entity "!<INPUT 1>!" and the main question "!<INPUT 2>!", generate a list of sub-questions that focus on observable details from an image containing the entity "!<INPUT 1>!".
Each sub-question should aim to extract specific, critical, and relevant information based on provided main question and observation of the image. Avoid broad or abstract questions that go beyond what can be directly inferred from the image.
If the image is required to answer the sub-question, please include the word "image" in the sub-question.

Given the main question: "!<INPUT 2>!" and the caption of the related image: "!<INPUT 3>!".

Your task is to decompose the main question into a list of sub-questions. Each sub-question should be easy and straightforward for the model to answer, closely connected to the image's content, and contribute towards answering the main question.

Please format the output as follows and separate each sub-question by a comma:
["sub-question 1", "sub-question 2", ...] (use ' instead of " in the sub-question)
